# Project Title

**Purchase Records** 

# About the Project 


Purchase Records is an assessment from Charter Communication that evaluates a candidateâ€™s ReactJS skill level by making an application that calculates reward points for customers based on the purchase price of each transaction. The candidate is responsible for choosing the data structure that fits the given problem and rendering the expected data onto the UI using a table. A list of purchase transactions is measured over three months, where the transactions are grouped by months and customers.
